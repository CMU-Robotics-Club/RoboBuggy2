# RoboBuggy Teensy Breakout PCB

This project initially started out as a generic PCB that could be modified for more specific uses.
However, it ended up being a do-all solution for RoboBuggy.

The PCB has a relatively small footprint and provides peripherals/supporting electronics for a Teensy 4.1 board.
Features include:
- Power management (5V regulator)
- CAN Bus
- UART
- SPI
- I2C
- Dynamixel I/O
- GPIO breakout
- External 5V and 3.3V power (<500mA)
- USB serial port (using FTDI chip)

To load/edit, download Altiun Designer. The software is free for students.

The PCB was manufactured using JLCPCB and assembled by-hand using solder paste + a reflow oven in Roboclub.
