class World:
    """Abstraction for the world coordinate system

    The real world uses GPS coordinates, aka latitude and longitude. However,
    using lat/lon is bad for path planning for several reasons. First, the difference
    in numbers would be very tiny for small distances, alluding to roundoff errors.
    Additionally, lat/lon follows a North-East-Down coordinate system, with headings
    in the clockwise direction. We want to use an East-North-Up coordinate system, so
    that the heading is in the counter-clockwise direction.

    We do this by converting GPS coordinates to UTM coordinates, which are in meters.
    UTM works by dividing the world into a grid, where each grid cell has a unique
    identifier. A UTM coordinate consists of the grid cell identifier and the "easting"
    and "northing" within that grid cell. The easting (x) and northing (y) are in meters,
    and are relative to the southwest corner of the grid cell.

    Last, we offset the UTM coordinates to be relative to some arbitrary zero point. That
    way, the final world coordinates are relatively close to zero, which makes debugging
    easier.

    This class provides methods to convert between GPS and world coordinates. There is
    a version for single coordinates and a version for numpy arrays.
